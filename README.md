# Notice
This repository will be replaced by repository name: chat-socketio-nest

# Prerequisite
Please run the following command from the root directory.
- npm run install-all
- npm run client
- npm run server

Please note: you need to run the client and the server in separate terminals.

# Motivation
I made this project to test out real-chat application feature by using nest.js and react.js simultaneously.
With the combination of websocket in nest.js and socket.io, I left some possibilities that this log can be recorded by using extra node.js module such as Winston in future.

# Limitation
Due to security concerns related to tokens in public environments, this project does not include serverless features.

If you have any questions, please feel free to send me a direct message to my Linkedin account :)
